# WellNest Marketing Insights - Project Overview

### The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of marketing campaigns at WellNest in order to surface recommendations on marketing budget allocation across future campaign categories.

Since its founding in 2016, WellNest has grown into a trusted medical insurance provider, now serving thousands of members across the United States. In 2019, the marketing team introduced several themed campaign categories—centered around wellness tips, affordability, and preventative care—to drive engagement and support brand positioning. Customers currently choose from four plan tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum), each offering different levels of premium costs and coverage.

With the addition of a new data team and a renewed focus on optimizing marketing spend, WellNest is now positioned to better evaluate how these campaign categories influence both customer signups and downstream patient claims. As we allocate this year’s marketing budget, our efforts are aligned around two key business objectives: increasing customer signups and expanding national brand awareness. Insights from this analysis will directly inform campaign prioritization, resource allocation, and performance measurement going forward.
